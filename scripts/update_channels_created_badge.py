"""Refresh the public "Channels Created" badge on the README.

WHAT THIS DOES. Adds up how many channels this plugin has created, reading its
own tally inside the Dispatcharr container, and writes a Shields.io endpoint
document to a GitHub Gist. The README badge points at that Gist, so this script
is what makes the public number change.

    python scripts/update_channels_created_badge.py            # refresh the Gist
    python scripts/update_channels_created_badge.py --dry-run  # print, write nothing
    python scripts/update_channels_created_badge.py --create   # first-time Gist setup

WHAT COUNTS AS ONE CHANNEL CREATED. One channel row created by one run of Sync
Channels Only or Full Sync. It is a count of creations performed, not an
inventory of channels that still exist, so a channel later removed by the
unmatched-channel cleanup does not subtract and the number cannot go down. A run
that created nothing still records a line, which is why the pass count can be
larger than you expect.

WHERE THE NUMBER COMES FROM. `/data/lineuparr_channel_counts.jsonl`, one JSON
object per finished run, written by the plugin itself rather than derived here.
Deriving it was considered and rejected: the channels this plugin creates are
ordinary Dispatcharr rows, indistinguishable afterwards from ones made by hand or
by another plugin, and some are deleted again by the unmatched-channel cleanup,
so no total can be reconstructed from the database.

THE NUMBER IS A FLOOR, AND STARTS AT THE DEPLOY. Nothing before the tally
shipped was recorded. It was deliberately NOT seeded: measured 2026-09-05, the
installation this runs on had no channel group matching the configured lineup's
prefix, and its 1,477 channels sat in groups belonging to the operator's existing
library, so any seed would have credited this plugin with another plugin's work.
A run whose tally write failed is missing too: the plugin logs a warning and
carries on rather than failing a sync over a counter.

PRIVACY. The tally holds integers and the word sync_channels. No channel name,
no group name, no lineup filename, no URL, no hostname. Only the summed integer
reaches the Gist. The Gist is unlisted rather than private and the README names
it, so treat the number as public.
